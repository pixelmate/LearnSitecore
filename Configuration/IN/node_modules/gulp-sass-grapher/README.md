[![Dependency Status][depstat-image]][depstat-url] [![devDependency Status][devdepstat-image]][devdepstat-url]

A gulp plugin for passing only the root SASS files down the stream. Unlike other plugins this one accounts for rebuilding the graph index when new files are added along with a manual API to rebuild the index.

  gulp.task('watch-styles', function() {
    var loadPaths = path.resolve('src/sass');
    sassGrapher.init('src/sass', { loadPaths: loadPaths })
    return watch('src/sass/**/*.scss', { base: path.resolve('src/sass') })
      .pipe(sassGrapher.ancestors())
      .pipe(sass({

      }))
      .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/css'))
